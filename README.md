# simple-todo-app
A simple todo app built with node and express.

## Depedencies:
* [EJS](https://ejs.co/) - a simple templating language that lets you generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript
* [Body-parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/body-parser) - Node.js body parsing middleware.
* [Nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) - a tool that helps develop node.js based applications by automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected.
